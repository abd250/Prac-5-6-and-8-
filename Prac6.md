Baggage Handling System
========================

Baggage Handling System design is a complex and needs effective design and test strategy. As a result, there are stipulated
key points that need to be considered: 
1.	Project Scope. Here, the scope of the project needs to be well defined. 
This is because the proper definition of the project scope establishes the hidden requirement that needs 
consideration in finalizing project plan and budget. 
2.	The second point that should be considered is systems logical and physical design,
this is because logical and physical design is core for proper system implementation. 
Notablely, there are diverse risks that are eminent in project design and include the following: 
a.	Business Process Interruption Risk that rarely get noticed and can hamper the existing business.
b.	The second risk is back up plan that gives an alternative way to the effective and smooth running of the business process.


The other important aspect of baggage handling system design is the testing approach. Indeed, the Baggage Handling System
utilizes the specified tests: 
1.	Load testing which is done by the simulation of live environment through the use of industry specified simulators and 
other similar software’s.  
2.	The second testing approach is functional and constitutes testing the functionalities of the system as described in 
the design format. Basically, the part of testing process consist resource utilization and system usability. 
3.	Resource utilization is done once the new system is put into place and system usability purely stipulates on the use of 
the baggage handling system. 
4.	Though not very important, acceptance testing is also done to envisage that the user has a complete acceptance of the system.


Most important, the baggage handling system is divided into baggage check-in and baggage carrousel. When the check–in 
is well done, the system easily sets destination, associates barcode with destination and print label. 
The baggage carrousel requires much testing and has increased complexity than the other parts of the baggage handling system.
Therefore, Carrousel testing is done in the following procedures: 
1.	First, start small and track the bag down a single conveyor belt. Second, move on to the multiple tracks with off ramps
and work on the diverting bags. 
2.	Then, combine the first two procedures to make sure that all bags are diverted even when one track gets full. 
3.	Adding of all other functionalities is done on ensuring that all other original functionalities are working well. 
There are three most important types of testing and three less important:
1.	The most important are unit, integration, and prototyping. 
2.	The less important are system tests, low volume beta tests and informal code reviews.
There are various systems associated with baggage system handling and design. These problems are categorized as both baggage
carrousel and baggage check in problems. The baggage check in problems constitutes getting destination and barcode alignment.


In conclusion
=============
Baggage handling system design is complex and has to be done with a lot of care and caution. This is because both project
scope and logical and physical design needs to be accurate. Moreover, the system designing is associated with two main risks
that include both back up plan risks and business interruption risks. Notablely, the in baggage handling system, there are
diverse tests that need to be incorporated at all time in both Carrousel and check- in. Therefore, the entire process of Baggage
Handling has specified procedures, process and problems and needs to be carefully executed.
