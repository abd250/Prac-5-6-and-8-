Pair Programming
================
In the existence of two developer/coder works in the same work station, then the strategy of pair programming is said to 
be applicable. As such for the developers one is said to be a driver and the other an observer. Keyboard driving and coding is
done by the driver while the observer scrutinizes the driver and gives response or in simple terms watches the concerns in
the system. 
Although the concept of pair programming was unfamiliar to me, 
it has numerous advantages compared to one man encoding:   
•	The fact that someone is observing you makes more devoted and serious during the session
since every bit of work is closely scrutinized. 
•	This means that at the end the programming somebody else will be involved in evaluating the output and
logic applied during the session. Basically this means that the observer will be the one to identify
the possible bugs when the process comes to a halt. 
•	The systems stand as a result is more exact and specific. 
•	Pair programming provides shortcuts to obtaining answers and provides knowhow of how other models can be used in programming. 
•	Both the coder and observer gain knowledge and expertise as opposed to one man programming and hence it supports team work 
and better ways of solving problems. 
•	The advantage over time is the hoard time during bug fixing and reduced development timing.    

In a similar way as the famous saying purports that everything with an advantage has some disadvantage, 
pair programming is not without challenges: 
•	One is the aspect of pressure that manifests itself in the continuous surveillance by the partner and hence very little
autonomy and breathing space. 
•	Compare output of two people at the end of the session is not worth that of two people
and more especially if the task is not complex by nature. 
•	In addition, for an experienced programmer who tackles the issue before it arrives, pair programming is not worth it despite
leaving a few bugs at the end of any session.Despite mentioning the above challenges I must acknowledge several effects 
that worked well during the pair programming. 
•	Of paramount importance is the aspect of two minds working together in solving complex issues. 
This translated to numerous solutions and easy answers to the problems that pose a challenge to human kind. 
•	The problems are solved with ease and quickly since one works while the other monitors and evaluates the output. 
•	Additionally, working together basically means sharing knowhow and hence less creepy-crawl.

In the event of future engagement in pair programming, I will have to amend the following things: 
•	One, as noted in the previous programming, a lot of time was wasted during coding and therefore to avoid such a situation
from recurring, I will have an objective and a plan before beginning coding. 
•	Secondly, I will put in writing the problem during argument instead of waiting to do this during the coding time.

Conclusion
==========
In conclusion, I would like to postulate that:
•	Pair programming is cost effective and time saving when the subject to be resolved is complex in nature. As such it is
not worth undertaking pair programming on simple matters. An amputated focus or lost logic to the developer may mean that 
the character of the system can go wrong. 
•	However, in the event of such a case the second programmer provides his/her response and hence precise outcomes are realized.
